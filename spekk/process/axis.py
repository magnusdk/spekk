    In the context of a transformation, an Axis is a way to get the concrete axis-index
    of an array, and also to specify what happens to that dimension in the
    transformation.

    By default, the dimension is removed, which makes sense for common operations like
    numpy.sum or numpy.mean. If you want to keep the dimension, set keep=True. If you
    want to replace the dimension with something else, set becomes=(something, else).
